## Hi, I'm Adilzhan Shukenov 👋

👨‍💻 Full-Stack Software Engineer

I specialize in building scalable, type-safe web applications. Most of my daily contributions happen within private enterprise environments, where I focus on performance, clean architecture, and seamless API integrations.

🛠 Tech Stack & Expertise

Frontend: Next.js (App Router, SSR/SSG), TypeScript, MobX (State Management).

Backend: NestJS (Modular Architecture), Node.js, REST APIs.

Database: MongoDB (Mongoose, Aggregations).

Networking: Axios (Interceptors, Custom Hooks, Type-safe fetching).

🚀 Professional Focus

Because my primary work is in private repositories, here is a summary of what I do:

Type-Safe Development: Leveraging TypeScript across the entire stack to ensure code reliability and catch errors before they hit production.

Efficient State Management: Using MobX to manage complex client-side state with an emphasis on reactivity and performance.

Modular Backend Design: Building scalable services with NestJS, focusing on Dependency Injection and clean separation of concerns.

API Architecture: Designing and consuming robust REST APIs using Axios for optimized data fetching and error handling.

NoSQL Modeling: Architecting flexible data schemas in MongoDB to handle high-frequency data operations.
